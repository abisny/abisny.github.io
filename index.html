          <p>I am a third year undergraduate student at University of Michigan - School of Information in Ann Arbor, working towards a BS information science, with a focus in UX Design and a minor in computer science.</p>
          <p>My work experience includes a summer internship (2017) at LiftForward, a small financial services company in NYC, and a summer internship (2018) at a start-up technology company in Tel Aviv, Israel working to increase the accesibility of mobile-first development.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>LiftForward: I worked with a team of six full-stack developers to develop and maintain a commercial site for a financial services company. Their business consists of partnerships with technology companies, including Microsoft and Intel, in order to lease their products to businesses [and consumers]. My team worked with Ruby-on-Rails and Ember.js to keep the site up and running, and up to date.</li>
            <li>Sparkly.io: I worked directly with the CTO of this start-up in Tel Aviv to rebuild Sparkly's website from scratch. Sparkly's goal is to encourage and make mobile-first development (specifically in the field of advertising) accessible to companies of all sizes and financial capabilities. The CTO and I were reorganizing the codebase, adding new features to the drag-and-drop platform, and converting C# code into JavaScript.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>During summer 2019, I will be working as a Technology Summer Analyst at Morgan Stanley, in their wealth management division. I will be designing, developing, and maintaining applications used daily by employees and clients. More specifically, my duties will entail meeting with clients/users to gather requirements, and then evaluating the feedback in order to integrate solutions efficiently and accurately.</p>
